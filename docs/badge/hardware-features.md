title: Hardware features and pinout

## Hardware overview

The badge is powered a powerful ARM Cortex-M4 Processor with 1MB of internal Flash memory (which holds the CircuitPython operating system), 16MB of external Flash memory (where your Python code and files are stored), and built-in Bluetooth Low Energy 5 and ZigBee Radio.

The hardware includes a 296x128 E-Paper display, 3-axis accelerometer, two RGB smart LEDs (NeoPixel/WS2812), a vibration motor, 5 input buttons, a USB-C connector, and a LiPo battery recharging circuit.

## Extension ports

The badge includes two hardware extension ports. They both include I2C connectivity:

- Front port with 6 pins: VCC, GND, SCL, SDA, GPIO1, GPIO2.
- Back port with 8 pins: VCC, GND, SCL, SDA, D1, D2, D3, D4.

The GPIO1/2 and D1/2/3/4 pins are digital GPIO pins that can be used for any purpose.
GPIO1/2 can also be used as analog inputs.
