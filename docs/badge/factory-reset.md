1. Plug the badge into your computer. Note the orientation of the USB-C cable!
2. A USB drive should show up. Delete all files! 
3. Download the latest code version from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/aramcon-badge/aramcon-firmware/releases) (badge-firmware.zip), and unzip it to the badge's USB drive.

Enjoy!
